# Traffic-Light-Verilog-
The "Traffic_Light_Controller" project is a Verilog-based implementation of a traffic light controller module. The module utilizes a finite state machine (FSM) design to control the sequence and timing of traffic lights. The code includes a main module, "Traffic_Light_Controller.v," which defines the FSM behavior and output signals for the traffic lights. The accompanying testbench, "Traffic_Light_Controller_Testbench.v," provides a simulation environment to verify the correctness of the traffic light controller module. By examining the simulation waveform, users can observe the expected state transitions and output changes, ensuring the proper functioning of the traffic light controller.
